# Stations of the Cross: Bootstrap Carousel Audio E-booklet

```version: v0.1.2``` (minor audio and visual updates and Bootstrap workaround fix)

## About:

* This is an interactive audio drama & e-booklet html page. 
* Audio dynamically changes between carousel pages via a predefined json event sequence. 
* Javascript was used to take a single big image and slice it into segments to form a booklet sequence. 

**The Stations of the Cross** or the Way of the Cross, refers to a series of images depicting Jesus Christ on the day of his crucifixion.

**Guide:**

* This App is intended to be read at a story telling pace. The sound score gradually evolves with the story. The pictures and the words are supposed to compliment each other.

* If your scroll though this too fast... you will miss the contexual details I composed into this app.

* I wanted to keep this small, so the sound variety is a bit limited. Less than 7 MB, about the size of 1 full length song. (You can write your own piece if you are musically inclined.)
